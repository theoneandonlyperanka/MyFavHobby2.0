        <h1> Hi! I'm Priyanka. I'm going to tell you about my favorite hobby.</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Through drawing I feel I can express the various emotions I feel, train of thoughts, and collective feelings. Sometimes when I feel like I need to get away from life and relax, I draw, and it helps me a lot. Shy people, or people with verbal disabilities also find drawing a better communication to speak or interact with others.</p>

        <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My favorite hobby is drawing. Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface. Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint). Digital drawing is the act of using a computer to draw. Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse. There are many digital art programs and devices.</p>
